## Evaluate the Model

> Log Loss function

Is one of the way to evaluate the model. 
It's to understand your model's uncertainity about a given prediction.
Log loss enables you to measure how strongly the model believes that its prediction is accurate. 


>> Inference : Using your model to solve real problems. 

> When you perform inference using supervised learning, you generate predictions.

> When you perform inference using unsupervised learning, you find patterns in your data.

> Models are made specific by the data used to train them, and therefore you need a trained model before you can start generating predictions.
