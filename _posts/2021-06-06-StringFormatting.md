## String Formatting

> Better than using quotes and plus symbol each time, which produces a new string every time a plus symbol is used.  

```

    int nephew1Age = 9;
    int nephew2Age = 12;
    int nephew3Age = 14;

    System.out.printf("The ages of my nephew's are %d, %d, %d%n", nephew1Age, nephew2Age, nephew3Age);
```

> Decimal formatting.

    double pi = Math.PI;
    System.out.printf("Pi value in 3 decimal places is %.3f",pi);

```
