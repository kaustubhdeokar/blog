> I'm a programmer, lost in this massive, ever-growing world of binaries. 
Here is my way to cope up with the same, and note down my daily progress.

> I love playing lawn tennis, football, infact all outdoor sports. From reading books, watching movies or shows, to invest in stock markets, to be update with happenings of my country (India), and mostly importantly things that involve a computer!.
