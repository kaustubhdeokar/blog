### Defining the Problem

First step is defining the problem. 

* Should be specific. 
* Identify the machine learning task

Machine Learning task is nothing but the technique used to solve the issue. 

> Supervised & Unsupervised learning are two different types of machine learning tasks. 

> A task is supervised if you are using labeled data. We use the term labeled to refer to data that already contains the solutions, called labels.

> Unsupervised learning involves using data that doesn't have a label. One common task is called clustering. 

Clustering helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
