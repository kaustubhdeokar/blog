> Artificial Intelligence refers to a broad capability of a machine, to perform actions having human like intelligence. 

* Machine Learning is a type of AI, it allows computers to learn from experience without explicitly being programmed to do so. It can discover patterns and make predictions. 
  *  Supervised learning , learning is done from data which is sampled.
  * Unsupervised learning, isn't not sampled, as it tries to learn the underlying pattern from the data. 
  * Reinforcement learning: What actions to take in a certain environment to maximise rewards. 

<p> Machine learning is a new field created at the intersection of statistics, applied math, and computer science.

### ML Steps

> A model is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.

> Model training algorithms work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

> Model inference is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.
