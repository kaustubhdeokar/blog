> Artificial Intelligence refers to a broad capability of a machine, to perform actions having human like intelligence. 

* Machine Learning is a type of AI, it allows computers to learn from experience without explicitly being programmed to do so. It can discover patterns and make predictions. 
  *  Supervised learning , learning is done from data which is sampled.
  * Unsupervised learning, isn't not sampled, as it tries to learn the underlying pattern from the data. 
  * Reinforcement learning: What actions to take in a certain environment to maximise rewards. 

<p> Machine learning is a new field created at the intersection of statistics, applied math, and computer science.
